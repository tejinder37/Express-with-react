http => hypertext transfer protocol

when we create a server we need some kind of data transfer protocols & in most cases the protocol
is http & in secure environment it is https.

http has some method to transmit data over network.

get , put , post , delete

when try to connect mongodb use mongoose orm to connect & make schema then model & then mongoose will automatically create models inside the database.
